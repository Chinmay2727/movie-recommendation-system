# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A machine learning project that builds a personalized movie recommendation system using collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. Designed to suggest relevant movies based on user preferences, item similarity, and rating behavior.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The recommendation system was developed to solve the classic problem of information overload in movie selection. It uses:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommendations based on user-user or item-item similarities
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommendations based on movie metadata
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both strategies for improved results

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** using cosine similarity  
- **Item-Based Filtering** based on genre overlap  
- **Feature Engineering** using genres, rating averages, and user behaviors  
- **Heatmaps & Histograms** for understanding user rating distributions  
-  Modular notebook cells for preprocessing, similarity computation, and recommendation generation
